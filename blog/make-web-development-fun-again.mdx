Building a website used to be fun.

It's not anymore because we take ourselves too seriously:

* side-hustle lifestyle
* proof that we know how to skill
* part of our picture-perfect Instagram lifestyle

We can put the fun back into development by creating a website like the teenage webmasters of olden times.

* start building without a plan
* add content because you can
* gaze at your own navel and own the solipsism

By doing this we can:

* have more fun
* enjoy the satisfaction of creating something out of nothing
* take action instead of getting lost in planning
