Example of my grad school writing that fucking sucks.

Say what you mean.

Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?

Show, don't tell

Pet peeve time: we kindly ask. 

Do you want your customer to think that you're kind?

Great. Then be kind. 

You might disagree. Your teacher told you to. Formal language is supposed to be more polite. It's better for customer service interactions.

Consider the possibility that your 8th grade language arts teacher wasn't a great writer. Many aren't. 

Teachers aren't paid to be great writers. Their (more difficult and important) job is to translate high-level curriculum standards to the reality of a classroom. Technical writing chops take a backseat to classroom management skills and evidence-based pedagogy.

Plus, teachers work in classrooms, not companies. They don't reply to customer services emails on the daily. 

The problem with "kindly" is that it comes across as inauthentic.

I am disinclined to acquiese to your request.

Data that actual humans value authentic interactions.

It's very important. I just wanted to.

I overuse the word "just." My emails are littered with it. 

* I just wanted to let everyone know that I've updated the digital assets folder with a transparent background version of the logo.
* Just to clarify, does that mean you'd like to upgrade the order to overnight shipping?
* Could you just go ahead and generate the reports from Wine Direct and export them, individually, to a shared directory so I can automate the montly dashboarding using PowerPivot?


If you don't mind. When you get a moment.
