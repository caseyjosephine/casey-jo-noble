Once, in the tasting room, a guest asked me "What’s the dumbest wine question you’ve ever been asked?”

That’s easy: I had someone ask what the little trees were that grew in straight lines, low to the ground, all across the Napa Valley. I was a bit taken aback by this question, but I knew exactly what she was talking about.

"You mean, the vines?"" I asked. She nodded her head.

"Oh yes, I think that’s it! What do you use them for?" at this point, I kind of wondered if she was fucking with me, but I got the feeling that she was being entirely serious.

"Well, we use them to grow grapes, which we harvest and ferment to make wine," I explained. Her eyes grew a bit bigger, and she nodded even more vigorously.

“Wow! So the wine is made out of grapes!" I could tell that this was the first time she had considered the fact that wine is made out of grapes. "You should really put that on the label!"

Are you already aware that wine is made out of grapes? Congratulations: whatever dumb question you have about wine, it’s not the dumbest question I’ve ever been asked. Conversely, if you’re just now learning that wine is made out of grapes, congratulations: you now know the most basic wine fact I can think of.
